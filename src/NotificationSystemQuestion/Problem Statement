Machine Coding Round: Notification System
🔔 Problem Statement
Design and implement a Notification System that supports sending messages to users via multiple channels (Email, SMS, Push).
Each user can choose one or more channels.
The system should:

Allow easy addition of new channels.

Log all sent messages.

Be extensible to support retry and decorators in the future.

Demonstrate basic functionality through a main() method.

🧱 Functional Requirements
✅ Users have a name and a list of preferred channels.

✅ System must send a Notification (with a message) to the user on all their channels.

✅ All messages sent must be logged (e.g., “Sending SMS to X: message”).

✅ You should be able to add a new channel like Slack or WhatsApp easily.

📦 Deliverables
Functional Java code that compiles and runs

Interface-based design (OOP)

Logger (Singleton)

Optional: Retry mechanism via Decorator

main() method to simulate sending to multiple users

🧠 Suggested Design (Use SOLID + Strategy)
Entities:
User: name, list of NotificationChannel

Notification: message

NotificationChannel: interface

EmailChannel, SMSChannel, PushChannel: concrete classes

NotificationService: sends to user

Logger: Singleton

✅ Apply Strategy, Singleton
🔄 Optional: Decorator, Factory (future extensibility)

🧭 Next Step:
Would you like me to:

Give you this as an assignment prompt to try for 45–60 min?

Share the interview-perfect implementation directly so you study and modify?

Scaffold starter files and let you fill in the logic?

Let me know your preferred flow — I’ll then show how Myntra/Paytm-style prompts are system design questions, not machine coding, and explain those too.

yes first give me the assignment prompt for 60mins, then i will give u what i am thinking then we will talk on how to move forward

Perfect! Here's your LLD Machine Coding Assignment Prompt for the Notification System — just like in interviews. Take ~60 minutes to design and implement it.

🧪 LLD Assignment: Notification System
⏱️ Duration: 60 minutes
💻 Language: Java (OOP preferred, no framework needed)
🎯 Problem Statement
Design a Notification System that allows sending notifications to users via one or more channels: Email, SMS, and Push.

📌 Functional Requirements
Define a User who can register for multiple notification channels.

Each Notification contains a message.

The system must:

Send a message to all enabled channels for a user.

Log all notification events (using a Logger).

You should be able to add a new channel (e.g., Slack) with no modification to existing code.

Demonstrate your code via a main() method where:

At least 2 users are created.

Each user has different channel preferences.

A notification is sent to each user.

Output should print each message sent and a corresponding log.

🔐 Constraints
Avoid if-else or switch for channel logic.

Follow SOLID principles where applicable.

Use design patterns like Strategy, Singleton.

Bonus: Support future enhancement for logging, retry, filtering via Decorator pattern.

🔧 Example Output:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
[LOG] Sending Email to Alice: Hello!
Email: Hello!

[LOG] Sending SMS to Bob: Hi!
SMS: Hi!
[LOG] Sending Push to Bob: Hi!
Push: Hi!
🧱 Expected Classes
Class	Responsibility
User	Holds name and list of preferred channels
Notification	Holds the message text
NotificationChannel	Interface for sending (Strategy)
EmailChannel / SMSChannel / PushChannel	Implements sending
NotificationService	Orchestrates sending to users (Facade-ish)
Logger	Singleton that logs to console

🚀 Deliverables
User.java

Notification.java

Interface + concrete implementations

NotificationService.java

Logger.java (Singleton)

Main.java with test simulation



RESULT:
So, in the service we can add the new class we make and overload the function of notify in that
then in the factory we add the choice in the supplier of the notification
which is then called in the main fn;
